# PHOTO GALLERy

This is a personal gallery application that displays my photos for others to see and gives a brief description of each image.

#### A user of the application will be able to:

- View different photos that interest me
- Click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details of the photo
- Search for different categories of photos
- Copy a link to the photo to share with friends
- View photos based on the location they were taken
